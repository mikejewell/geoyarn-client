		"content":"I wandered thoughtfully away for some time, away from the road, and the trees, until I saw it. It loomed in my vision ahead, the great shadow of a giant of brick and glass, of concrete and steel. I had always remembered it as something smaller, but now the old building seemed to tower above with walls unchanged by time. I touched its walls and remembered the time I had first come here, when I had first gazed up at the face of this place and smiled. It felt back then that I would never leave, that I had found my place in the world. I was wrong, as people often are, and time had seen us travel far apart. We had both changed, in ways neither of us understood. I put the piece of paper back in my bag, Ford could wait, and took it off my shoulder. I leant against the brick work, and pretended, just for a moment, I had never left.",
